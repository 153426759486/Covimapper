        <p><h1>Diffrence between COVID-19 & Flu</h1>
            Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is </br>caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.
        </br>COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take </br>longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. More information about differences between </br>flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.
            Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.
            While more is learned every day about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, there is still a lot that is unknown . This page compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available information to date.</p>
