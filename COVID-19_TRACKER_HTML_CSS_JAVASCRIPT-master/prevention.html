<div class="heading2">Physical distancing, masks, vaccines , and other preventive measures: </div>
<div class="preventionimg"></div>
<div class="para1">Getting vaccinated and boosted is the best way to reduce your risk of symptoms, especially becoming severely ill, if you get COVID-19.
<br>But right along with vaccination are steps you can take to both avoid getting infected and help prevent spreading the virus to others.
<br>They include wearing your mask when you need to, avoiding crowds, and maintaining physical distance.</div>
<div class="heading3">What can I do to protect myself and others from COVID-19?</div>
<div class="heading4">The following actions help prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza.
  <br><br>
  <div style="position: relative; left: 20px;">

    <ul>
      <br><li>Wear a face mask in public indoor spaces.</li>
      <br><li>Maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and others.</li>
      <br><li>Avoid large gatherings.</li>
      <br><li>Socialize outdoors.</li>
      <br><li>Get vaccinated and boosted as soon as you are eligible.</li>
      <br><li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
      <br><li>Minimize touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.</li>
      <br><li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
      <br><li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.</li>
      <br><li>Clean frequently touched objects and surfaces regularly.</li>
      <br><li>Wash your hands often with soap and water.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

</div>
<div class="heading5">How does coronavirus spread?</div>
<div class="para2">The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person. A person infected with coronavirus — even one with
<br>no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe. Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can
<br>float or drift around in the air for up to three hours. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become
<br>infected with the coronavirus.</div>
<div class="para3">When people are in close contact with one another, droplets that are produced when an infected person
<br>coughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs.</div>
<div class="para4">Transmission is less likely to happen outdoors, where air currents scatter and dilute the virus, than in a
<br>home, office, or other confined space with limited air circulation.
 <br><br>The risk of spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is considered to be extremely low.
 <br>According to the CDC, each contact with a contaminated surface has less than a 1 in 10,000 chance of causing
 <br>an infection.
 <br><br>The virus may be shed in saliva, semen, and feces; whether it is shed in vaginal fluids isn't known. Kissing
  <br>can transmit the virus. Transmission of the virus through feces, or during vaginal or anal intercourse or oral
  <br>sex, appears to be extremely unlikely at this time.</div>
<div class="spreadimg"></div>
<div class="heading6">Should I wear a face mask?</div>
<div class="para5">The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through viral particles that float in the air or
<br>through droplets containing virus. Even people who are infected but do not have symptoms, or have not yet
<br>developed symptoms, can infect others. Masks reduce the amount of virus we breathe in and breathe out.
<br>Combined with the vaccines and boosters, masks provide a one-two punch that reduces the risk of spread.
<br>Masks also provide protection for the wearer, even those who are fully vaccinated.
<br><br>As the latest COVID surge relaxes its grip in the US, many states, towns, and schools are removing their indoor
<br>mask mandates. The CDC also issued updated guidelines, tying mask use recommendations to levels of the
<br>virus in a given community. COVID levels may be categorized as low, medium, or high, and are calculated by
<br>looking at hospital beds being used by COVID patients, COVID-related hospital admissions, and the total
<br>number of new COVID-19 cases in an area. You can click here to check the COVID level in your county.
<br><br>According to the new CDC guidelines, everyone should mask indoors in public when COVID levels are high.
<br>People who are immunocompromised or at high risk for severe illness are encouraged to mask indoors when
<br>COVID levels are medium. When community levels are low, individuals can decide whether to mask indoors
<br>based on their individual risks and preferences.
<br><br>Here are some points to consider as you decide whether you and your family should continue masking indoors.
<div style="position: relative; left: 20px;">
<ul>
  
  <br><li>We’re still in the midst of a pandemic. As of late February 2022, there are nearly 2,500 COVID deaths per 
  <br>day in the US.</li>
  
  <br><br><li>Your decision should reflect your personal health risks: if you or a member of your family is at increased 
  <br>risk for infection or severe COVID illness, or if you are unvaccinated, continue masking indoors.</li>
  
  <br><br><li>Masking policies can’t always keep up with the virus. When COVID cases are high, consider masking 
  <br>indoors regardless of whether there’s a mask mandate in place.</li>
  
  <br><br><li>Your decision to mask indoors may change over time, and you may return to wearing a mask indoors
  <br>after a period of not masking indoors.</li>
  
  <br><br><li>Masking reduces the risk of spread to vulnerable populations: young children who are not yet eligible for
  <br>vaccines, people with weakened immune systems, older adults who are at increased risk for severe
  <br>illness, and others who are unvaccinated.</li>
  
  <br><br><li>Masks don’t just help to flatten the curve; they also help to prevent surges from happening in the first 
  <br>place.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<br><br>A high-quality, well-fitting mask provides good protection even if people around you are unmasked. High
<br>quality KN95, KF94, and N95 masks have the tightest fit and the best filtration. Make sure your mask
<br>completely covers your nose and mouth, and fits snugly against the sides of your face without leaving any
<br>gaps.

<br><br>Transmission is much less likely to occur outdoors, and masks are not needed in most outdoor settings.
</div>
<div class="heading7">What kind of mask should I wear?</div>
<div class="para6">Omicron is the most contagious variant we have come across yet, so high-quality, well-fitting masks are more
<br>important than ever. This is true for everyone, and even more so for anyone who is unvaccinated, at increased
<br>risk for severe illness, or caring for someone with COVID-19.</div>
<div class="mask2"></div>
<div class="para7">Not all masks are created equal. High quality KN95, KF94, and N95 masks have the tightest fit and the best
<br>filtration. Surgical masks are also effective at filtering out small viral particles. You can wear a cloth mask on
<br>top of a surgical mask to improve the fit. Or, you can adjust a surgical mask for a tighter fit using a method
<br>called "knotting and tucking." To knot and tuck a surgical mask, knot the ear loops of a 3-ply face mask
<br>where they join the edge of the mask, then fold and tuck the unneeded material under the edges. For video
<br>instructions on how to knot and tuck a surgical mask, click here. Avoid single-layer cloth masks, which may
<br>not be up to the task.

<br>When it comes to fit, make sure your mask completely covers your nose and mouth and fits snugly against
<br>the sides of your face without leaving any gaps.</div>
